            <p>
                <span class="p-accent">Life spent learning is a life well spent. </span> This has been my philosophy
                ever since I left my roots in Chicago, IL to begin my education at
                Butler University in 2011. In my time in Indianapolis, I was a devoted student of music and educator of
                students from all walks of life.
                From classical violin to progressive metal, my experiences and love of music are influenced by an
                immense catalogue of artists from around
                the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                After spending 3 years as a music educator both at home and abroad, my itch to learn new things could
                not be satisfied. I began working
                in the craft brewing industry and fell deep down the rabbit hole of the brewing process and learning
                from some of the best in the game.
                Yet with all of these trials and challenges as a beer slinger and music teacher, I yearned for more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here in Nashville, I have become a student yet again in perhaps my most ambitious learning challenge to
                date: become a web developer.
                What began as a general curiosity in coding led me to love the process of learning new skills and
                implementing them in web based projects,
                something that I find profoundly creative.
